# EmployyeeManagementSystem

An Employee Management System (EMS) using Advanced Java, JDBC, and Servlets is a web-based application designed to manage and maintain employee data within an organization. The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators and HR staff to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. Here's a detailed description of the project:

1. Project Overview
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based web application that uses Servlets and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a relational database (e.g., MySQL, Oracle). The system allows users to manage employee information efficiently, including adding new employees, updating existing employee details, deleting employee records, and viewing employee information.

2. Key Features of the System
The EMS typically includes the following functionalities:

Add Employee: Allows the user to add new employee details, such as name, designation, department, salary, contact information, and other relevant information.
View Employee: Enables the user to view the list of all employees and search for a particular employee using criteria like employee ID, name, or department.
Update Employee: Allows the user to update an employee's information, such as their designation, department, or salary.
Delete Employee: Enables the user to remove an employee's record from the system.
Login and Authentication: Secures the application by allowing only authorized users (admin or HR staff) to access the system.
